# Model Selection Approaches for Prostate Cancer Estimates
Several model selection strategies were implemented to find the best model fit to estimate prostate cancer. The prostate cancer data come from a study that examined the correlation between the level of prostate specific antigen and a number of clinical measures in men who were about to receive a radical prostatectomy. It is data frame with 97 rows and 9 columns. The data variables are as follows:

- lcavol: log(cancer volume)
- lweight: log(prostate weight)
- age: age of the patient
- lbph: log(benign prostatic hyperplasia amount)
- svi: seminal vesicle invasion
- lcp: log(capsular penetration)
- gleason: Gleason score
- pgg45: percentage Gleason scores 4 or 5
- lpsa: log(prostate specific antigen)
